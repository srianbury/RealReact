## Why??

I am commonly tasked with creating a view with an input and an a listview where the data in the listview is editable/deletable and and the edit form is the same as the input form.

I also use a HOC called withLoading to show a loading component while network requests are running for my different components.  I used setTimeout to simulate a network request.
